# Toggle Switch

This is a pure CSS/HTML toggle switch (or toggle button, or toggle bar - whatever your preference is) using Flexbox. 

I was looking for a toggle switch and found a pre-flexbox CSS/HTML template for one, plus a few with JS - I was trying to put this into a React app so I didn't want to start adding vanilla JS, and making any tweaks to the pre-flexbox CSS messed with what I already had for the site. So I made my own!
